      "developed a CRM Web-App from scratch which completely shifted the mode of working of their employees from Excel Sheets to Web-App. This is a fully responsive Web-App which uses the popular MERN-Stack. They used Excel sheets containing 5000-10000 mobile numbers and used to call each one and then fill the details on that particular mobile number i.e whether they picked the call or not, filling the next date the customer asks for a call back and remembering it as well etc. Admin faced another kind of issue, they used to transfer the complete excel sheets which contained numbers of people who might be potential customers for the organization and employees after the training period used to run-away with complete sheets and used to work independently which caused the organization a lot of financial losses. One has to differentiate between the newer and older sheets and sheets which had more refined mobile numbers.",
